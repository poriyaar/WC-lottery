# Simple Lottery Project for Game Prediction Winners

This is a simple PHP-based project designed to select winners from game predictions. I originally developed this project three years ago to learn the basics of raw PHP and MySQL, so itâ€™s great for beginners who want hands-on practice with fundamental PHP skills.

## Project Overview

This project provides a simple and functional lottery system. It takes data from a MySQL database of game predictions and randomly selects a winner. HTML and CSS are already included in the project files (not written by me), while all PHP and MySQL code is my own.

## Features

1. Uses PHP and MySQL without any frameworks.
2. Demonstrates basic CRUD operations with PHP.
3. Shows how to work with random selection for a lottery feature.
4. Database file is included, so you can set it up easily.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Import the included database file into MySQL.
3. Adjust the database connection settings in the PHP files if needed.
4. Run the project on a local server, such as XAMPP, WAMP, or Docker.
5. Use your browser to access the project and test the lottery selection.

## Prerequisites

1. Basic knowledge of PHP and MySQL.
2. A local server setup (like XAMPP or WAMP) or Docker for running the PHP code.

## Note for Beginners

This project is a basic example, suitable for those just starting out with PHP. By studying and modifying this code, you can gain experience with simple PHP structures, MySQL database integration, and randomization techniques.
